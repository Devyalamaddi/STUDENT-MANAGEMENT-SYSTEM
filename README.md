## 📚 Project Description
We have created a **Student Management System** using all the concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming** in **C++**. This system will take necessary details (Personal, Academic, and Achievement details) and display them to a user only if the correct login details are entered. This will help in faster management, insertion, and searching of a particular student record among millions of student records.

🎯 This project is primarily made for users who want to improve their knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in C++.
